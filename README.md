## Setting up development environment

1. Clone the repository

2. Make sure you are using latest stable version of node

3. Run the following command in the root directory of the repository

```
yarn
```

If you get some errors, ignore them and try to run the application with

```
yarn start
```

If it doesn't run, it might be because of native dependency (SQLite)
